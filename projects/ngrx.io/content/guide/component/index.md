# @ngrx/component

Component is a set of primitive reactive helpers to enable fully reactive, fully zone-less applications. They give more control over rendering, and provide further reactivity for Angular applications.

## Key Concepts

Rendering happens in the template only:
  - [Push Pipe](guide/component/push)
  - [Let Directive](guide/component/let)

**RxJS Operators**
To render observable values, or fix change detection this package provides a set of helpers operators trigger rendering:
  - [coalesce](guide/component/rxjs/operators/coalesce)

## Installation

Detailed installation instructions can be found on the [Installation](guide/component/install) page.
