# @ngrx/component

Component is a set of primitive reactive helpers to enable fully reactive applications.

## Introduction

This package includes primitives that act as the glue in reactive Angular applications.
They take over rendering and provide reactivity to parts where Angular doesn't out of the box. 

## Key Concepts
- Rendering happens in the template only:
  - [Push Pipe](guide/component/push)
  - [Let Directive](guide/component/let)
